Dearly beloved, fathers and sons, my name is Marcus Merritt, I am the founder of this digital arts studio - it is an 
interactive arts and interactive realities development studio. My goal is to make family and neighbor friendly arts 
exhibits that teach a ripe spiritual and secular history. Ages kindergarten to college will be given creative spaces that
are current to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics standards locally and internationally. Genealogly 
inclines research that will be based upon the life of Christ to cherish virtue - wholesome family traditions and  
heritages among a diverse people. 

As a parallel of the gospel of peace you will see unique worlds - wildlife and avatars - defined characters will 
represent the real world heroes shining tirelessly in the effort to combat cataclysm - to reduce pollution and corruption.
Games represent just one kind of long term projects: mobile optimized role playing simulations. Motivating this effort
is the Lords admonition to believe.

You will be presented rated "E" for everyone curated exhibits. You will be able to freely use the arts produced here, as
education resource. Playwritten adaptations distributed not for profit in the creative commons. Outside of internal 
projects beyond videogame technology I am accepting commissions. Nature and natural history and family history research 
projects. Enjoy and feel free to reach out.
